# SOLID

In object-oriented computer programming, the term SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by Robert C. Martin. Though they apply to any object-oriented design, the SOLID principles can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development. The SOLID acronym was introduced by Michael Feathers.

* [Single responsibility principle](https://ctrlaltdev.xyz/resources/SRP)
    a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. changes to only one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class).
* [Open/closed principle](https://ctrlaltdev.xyz/resources/OCP)
    "software entities â€¦ should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
* [Liskov substitution principle](https://ctrlaltdev.xyz/resources/LSP)
    "objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.
* [Interface segregation principle](https://ctrlaltdev.xyz/resources/ISP)
    "many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
* [Dependency inversion principle](https://ctrlaltdev.xyz/resources/DIP)
    one should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
